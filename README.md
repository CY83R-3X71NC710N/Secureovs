# Secureovs
Secureovs is a program created with Python that provides secure methods for users to store their sensitive data by utilizing secure hash libraries. Through the utilization of 'SHA-256' encryption keys, users can safely store their confidential information with the implicit trust that their data will not be breached.

## About the Project
The goal of Secureovs is to offer users the power to protect their privacy and confidential data securely. By utilizing Python’s hash libraries, users can stow away their private credentials without the risk of interception. The project is still currently in prototype phase and is being developed and worked upon to reach its full potential. 

## Getting Started
Secureovs is not yet available as a built application and currently exists in source form only. This means that any requests to use the program must be run on the user’s own machine in order to customize the URLs, keys, and such to fit your own usage requirements. As Secureovs is still in development, this will work as the user’s own starting platform to build out the app and reach its greatest capabilities. 

## Prerequisites
Secureovs is built to ensure maximum safety for the users' confidential data, and requires powerful materials to do so; therefore, a few prerequisites must be fulfilled before the app can be able to be run/installed. 
* Python 3.X
* Libraries (ex. Hash)

## Goals
The goal of the Secureovs project is to be able to provide a simple and secure way to store data reliably with the utmost privacy in mind. Its main intention is to provide an application that will create an encrypted key through the utilization of SHA-256 and allow users to store their credentials without the worry of interception. 

## Roadmap
The Secureovs application is still undergoing development where the primary focus is to improve the safety, reliability, and efficiency of the program. This includes working with database flexibility, hyperlinking, encryption algorithms, and improved password strength. As the project is currently in prototype form, any goals will be altered as development progresses.
